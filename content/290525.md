# Spainard shite
Hello, today i started work on this blog for my spanish class.
I know jack shit about spanish and my brain defaults to english for some reason.

It's very interresrting to me how i preffer to write in english. I suppose it's because the lack of accent markers makes it very fast to write.
Even if GNOME's method of inputing accents is much much better than any other OS I've ever used.
